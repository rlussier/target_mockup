This is a Mockup of the Target website. Right now, I'm only working on the frontend homepage before adding the backend.
For the frontend, I used NextJs, Typescript, Javascript, HTML, and SASS. 
For the backend, I will use Java and Kotlin.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
